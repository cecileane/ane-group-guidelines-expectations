- [advice to PhD students](https://www.ncbs.res.in/sites/default/files/users/sandhyab/PhDstudents.pdf)
- I have several of these short books from
  [ThinkWell](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/for-phd-students), tailored
  for PhD students.
  I highly recommend them! Feel free to borrow any one of them from me.

- summary notes on [computing tools](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/topics.html)
  e.g. git and shell commands
- great [course on Julia](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/),
  that you can do at your own pace and is easy to navigate.
  It includes a great introduction to learn the basics of Julia,
  and then more for optimization and machine learning.
