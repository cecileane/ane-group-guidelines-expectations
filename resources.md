- [advice to PhD students](https://www.ncbs.res.in/sites/default/files/users/sandhyab/PhDstudents.pdf)

- I have several of these short books from
  [ThinkWell](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop), and they have more
  [for PhD students](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/for-phd-students).
  I highly recommend these books! Feel free to borrow any one of them from me.  
  Among their free resources, this is a great ebook:
  "[The Balanced Researcher](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/free-books/ebook-the-balanced-researcher):
  Strategies for busy researchers"

- summary notes on [computing tools](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/topics.html)
  e.g. git and shell commands
- the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/) book is great to learn about git,
  which we use extensively in my group,
  and this [lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
  is great to understand git's data model.

- great [course on Julia](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/),
  that you can do at your own pace and is easy to navigate.
  It includes a great introduction to learn the basics of Julia,
  and then more for optimization and machine learning.

- practical suggestions for [mathematical writing](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202106/rnoti-p930.pdf)
  (Bell et al., 2021)
