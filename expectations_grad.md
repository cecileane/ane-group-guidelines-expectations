# expectations for PhD students

Please read my [general](expectations_general.md) expectations and
[computing](technical.md) & technical guidelines,
my expectations for graduate students in this section (below),
and what you can [expect from me](#what-you-can-expect-from-me).  
Then we should talk about your own expectations and your career goals,
starting from these [seed questions](#seed-items-for-discussion). 

- Revisit expectations yearly, adjust accordingly, discuss how can I support you better.

- Have an IDP for yourself, within 6 months in my group:
  [grad school IDP](https://grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan/).
  You don't need to share it with me, but feel free to do so, or to simply
  share a part of it, or any thoughts about career plans.
  I would be happy to encourage you to set specific goals,
  with specific timelines and specific implementation steps.
  In your research, we should define projects that fit with your career goal.
  It's okay to change your mind about career goals.

- Attend department seminars: they will broaden your knowledge of the field.

- Attend and participate at group meetings. Participation will include
  an occasional presentation of your in-progress research, something that will
  give you experience and confidence with oral communication skills.

- Understand that expectations about your competencies will change over time,
  and that you will develop as independent scientist. I do not expect you
  to be an independent researcher with deep knowledge of the field in year 1 of
  your PhD, and you should not place such an expectation on yourself either!
  (see [Verderame et al: 2018](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34801))

- By the end of your PhD: be an avid reader of research papers:
  at least 1 per week, that you will self-select.

- By the end of your PhD: publish at least 1 paper as a first author.

- As a TA or RA, your are an employee, see
  [GAPP](https://hr.wisc.edu/policies/gapp/) for policies and procedures.
  Your 40 hours of work per week should be divided between:
  taking courses (prior to being a dissertator),
  teaching (if TA),
  reading papers directly closely related to your research project,
  reading papers on broader topics less close to your topic,
  attending seminars, and working on your own research projects.
  Every workday, you should give priority to the latter:
  save the best 2 hours of your day (whenever your brain works best)
  to work on your own research projects.
  Schedule these research hours in your calendar and turn off notifications.

- Graduate Assistants earn paid vacation, with scheduling
  "subject to the approval of the supervisor"
  (from [GAPP](https://hr.wisc.edu/policies/gapp/#leave-benefits)).
  I expect you to discuss your vacation schedule in advance.
  I will also let you know of my own vacation schedule, and conference travel
  schedule in advance.

- Summers: I will encourage you to pursue what is best for your career goals,
  including industry internships. Be mindful that pausing your research over the
  summer will delay your research productivity and graduation time, compared
  to continuing to work on your research over the summer.

# what you can expect from me

- I will provide all the support I can to help you towards your success.
  I will strive to provide an environment in which you feel safe, encouraged,
  and supported.

- I will be available to meet you on a regular basis, and also available for
  conversations outside these scheduled times: whenever my door is open,
  you are welcome to come in.

- I will provide scientific guidance to help you design a project, set
  reasonable goals and timelines, and help you make progress towards the
  completion of your projects and publications.

- I will facilitate your professional development, such as the development of
  oral and written communication skills, and grant writing if this is of
  interest to you.

- I will strive to foster an increasing level of independence and responsibility
  as you progress through your PhD training.

- I will encourage you to present your research at meetings and conferences,
  and I will do my best to find funding for this.

- I will encourage your participation in professional development and networking
  opportunities, that aligns with your career goals.

- I will commit to being a supportive colleague as you transition to the next
  stage in your career: I recognize that the role of mentor continues after
  formal training ends.

- My background and prior experiences are unlikely to be like yours.
  Our worldview is shaped by our prior experiences. I respect yours.
  I may not understand your worldview at first, but I commit to listening,
  understanding where you come from if you would like to share,
  and helping you be *you* as a whole individual, as you progress towards your
  career goals.

# seed items for discussion

- What are your expectations of me? of the PhD program / department?
  You may look at these lists of questions to refine what you may want to ask me:
  * [developing shared expectations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nR7-NrxRbKNfEUhbmm0dY4vG6gBYbriE/view)
  * [action plan: what and how](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdQA4rMAdrPlMW7LMsE5pfBtDGZgKRBl/view)
  * or [expectation scales](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ia0srsYwj60YDajp5lOnEk_63E26b6AK/view?usp=sharingmJ4vW00mzyEvQzbNVbjA65XwTmrm):
    this form is to be filled out by both of us separately, before we meet
    to talk about it. Please check these out to pick topics of particular
    interest to you.

- What are your career goals?

- How should I communicate with you: email? slack?  
  When will be a good time to meet regularly?

- How to connect to others doing similar research?
