# expectations for undergraduate students

First, read my [general](expectations_general.md) expectations
and [computing](technical.md) & technical guidelines.  
Then, we should talk about your expectations and your career goals.

If you will be taking research credits (e.g. STAT 699, 681, 682),
then fill out this

after we discuss your project and

    to talk about it. Please check these out to pick topics of particular
    interest to you.
