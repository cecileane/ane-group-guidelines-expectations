# general expectations

- Be honest and open: I cannot guess what's on your mind.
  Tell me about any roadblocks, anything you don't understand,
  if you don't like a particular research direction, etc.
  I will be glad to hear your feedback with an open mind.
  My want to do my best to remove roadblocks and provide opportunities
  so you can reach your career goals.

- Be dedicated to your work, work hard, and produce good and reliable science.

- Meet with me regularly, typically once per week: the periodicity is
  something we should discuss, and it may change over time as you develop
  as an independent scientist.
  At our meetings, I expect you to bring something from your work during the week.
  Bring what worked and what did *not* work, questions on what you read, etc.
  I prefer that you share code and results the day before we meet so that I have
  the time to take a look before we meet: it will make our meeting all the more
  constructive.
  I prefer to meet in person for better communication, but I am open to
  occasional remote meetings, such as if one of us doesn't feel well.

- At any time, please communicate with me by email or slack.
  All questions are good and welcome. My primary goal is to support you and
  help remove roadblocks. In my inbox, your messages will have top priority.  
  I may respond quickly on weekends or evenings, but please do not expect me to
  do so, as I spend this time with family.
  Similarly, if I send you messages on weekends, I do *not* expect you to
  respond on weekends or evenings.

- Give me at least one week if you need me to work on anything for you
  (manuscripts, forms, recommendation letters, presentations, etc.)

- Document your work: I cannot emphasize this enough.
  Comment your code, organize your files and folders, organize your code with
  'readme' files to explain what each file does, how to run your pipeline etc.
  There are no "lab notebooks" in my group, but the need to document and share
  our work is still paramount.

- Share your work and code with me, and on a regular basis:
  using git & github, OSF, google drive, hackmd, etc.

- Learn and use best practices in scientific computing: see this
  [summary](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/notes0906-bestpractices.html)
  and [mindful programming](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md).

- In person vs remote work: all the work in my group is computational, so
  * good news: you can do this work from wherever you have access to a
    computer and internet. You can adjust your hours easily,
    every week differently if need be.
  * bad news: you may feel alone, setting a daily work routine may be difficult,
    and it's very easy to procrastinate.
    I expect you to set a structure for yourself, that I won't check.
    To help build structure and avoid procrastination, I suggest that you
    decide on a regular time for yourself to work on your research,
    and put these times in your calendar as if there was some external factor.
    Turn notifications off, to give yourself quality time to focus.
  * be intentional to make connections with others doing similar research:
    let's talk about how can help make these connections.

- Follow [computing](technical.md) and technical guidelines.
